# DeepGauge

DeepGauge is a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the robustness and quality of deep learning models. It introduces multiple layers of coverage criteria that offer insights into the internal behaviors of deep learning models during testing and validation.

## Features

- **Neural Coverage Criteria**: Introduces various coverage criteria to assess the decision regions of neural networks.
- **Multi-Granularity**: Supports coverage analysis at both neuron and layer levels.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Enhances traditional testing approaches by providing insights into model robustness through neuron activation patterns.
- **Flexible Integration**: Can be used with different deep learning models and architectures for in-depth analysis.
